# Clox implementation

### What's this?
Clox is a C implementation of lox interpreter following by the book by Robert Nystrom. 

His website: https://craftinginterpreters.com/ 

### What's new?
- Implemented a trie to recognize lox keywords.

### Usage:
```
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
  
```

### Updates
So far, I have completed all the milestones mentioned in the book, plus some of the minor functionality/sugar I came up with.  I'll pause the work here, and maybe come back in the future to improve it.
#### Functionalities on top of my mind
- Add package management support
- If possible, write some simple libraries
